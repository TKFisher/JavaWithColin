/*  Simple Week Output Exercise

1.) Create seven instances a Day object
   SAMPLE: Day three = new Day();
2.) Assign numerical value to each day of the week
   SAMPLE: three.dayNum = 3;
3.) Create method using if & else conditionals to determine what each dayâ€™s suffix is (ie. 1st, 7th)
   SAMPLE: six.determineSuffix();
4.) Output the results to look like this:

It's Monday, the 1st day of the week
It's Tuesday, the 2nd day of the week
It's Wednesday, the 3rd day of the week
It's Thursday, the 4th day of the week
It's Friday, the 5th day of the week
